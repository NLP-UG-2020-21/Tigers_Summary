# Summary
## Animals and Human Language

### Duality
**Duality** (double articulation) occurs in human language. It is organized at two levels. At physical level, which occurs when we speak, individual sounds are created such as *n*, *b*, *i*. None of these forms has any specific meaning. However, when we combine them into, for instance *bin* we get another level with a meaning which differs from the meaning of another combination as *nib*.  We can create many sound combinations that are distinct in meaning with little set of sounds.  Other creatures communicate in single fixed form which cannot be separated. The dog does not say *oowf*, *foow* as other forms of *woof*. However, if they did, each of these forms would have different meaning.
