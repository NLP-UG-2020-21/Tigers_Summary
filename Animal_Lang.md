# Summary
## Animals and Human Language

That animals can communicate with other members of their species, some people assume as a fact. Another theory defined by Terrence Deacon and his discovery, involves creatures imitating human sound. Such assumptions provoke many questions concerning language, its properties and finally communication involving humans and animals.

## Communication
The signals that a speaker sends to the hearer during a conversation might be of two different natures. Whenever you unintentionally inform someone about you without using your language, the signals that you provide is of communicative kind. In the opposite case, the intentional informing is considered to send informative signals to the hearer. The one exception to the theory concerns glossolalia, a religious phenomenon of human capacity of producing language-like sounds in a stream of speech with no communicative purpose. A discourse cannot be assumed intentional communication with no speaker control. As in the case of squawking animals in the danger and humans informative signals, we are both considered in terms of potential of intentional communication.

## Properties of human language
It is commonly agreed that creatures may communicate through different ways. However, only us, humans have the ability to reflect on the quality of our messages. Such feature called reflexivity is unique for our kind as we can use language and talk about language itself. When compared to animals, the property as such is a distinguishing yet not the only one feature of human language.

## Displacement
The language of animals is believed to be limited in time and place. In contrast to humans, dogs or cats canâ€™t really relate past events. What makes our communication unique and allows us to talk about things not present in the immediate environment, is another property of language called displacement. Although, however distinctive for humans, a limited version of such ability is also present among honeybee who is able to indicate a location some distance away. 

## Arbitrariness
It is commonly agreed that the connection between a linguistic form and its meaning is arbitrary. In other words, there is no natural relationship between words and objects. Such aspect of language is described as arbitrariness. Of course, there are some, however rare words which seem to have a less arbitrary connection or fit the concept they indicate (onomatopoeic).
When it comes to animal signals, there appear to be a connection between the message and the nature of signal they send. It is a fact that the language they use in order to communicate consists of a limited set of both vocal and gestural forms and which are used in specific situation or at particular time.

## Cultural transmission
A process of inheriting language from generations is described as cultural transmission. Clearly, humans are born with some kind of predispositions to acquire language, which is done first in a culture. Animals, on the other hand, are born with a set of signals that produced instinctively. There is evidence that instinct has to combine with learning in order to produce a relevant sound. By contrast, humans produce no instinctive language.

## Productivity
A human ability to create an infinite number of new expressions by manipulating the language is described as productivity. This is a property completely opposed to what animals can actually do with their communication system consisting of fixed and immutable set of signals relating to a particular situation. Such lack of productivity can be described in terms of fixed reference.

## Duality
**Duality** (double articulation) occurs in human language. It is organized at two levels. At physical level, which occurs when we speak, individual sounds are created such as *n*, *b*, *i*. None of these forms has any specific meaning. However, when we combine them into, for instance *bin* we get another level with a meaning which differs from the meaning of another combination as *nib*.  We can create many sound combinations that are distinct in meaning with little set of sounds.  Other creatures communicate in single fixed form which cannot be separated. The dog does not say *oowf*, *foow* as other forms of *woof*. However, if they did, each of these forms would have different meaning. 

## Talking to Animals
Human language is a unique communication system. Other creatures are not able to understand it. However, we might assume that they do, because of their behaviour when they hear specific commands such as *Heel* to dogs, *Up*, *Down*, *Roll over* to circus animals. They seem to understand them because of their response, however it cannot be the evidence. They respond particularly to the sound stimulus but do not actually understand the meaning of the noise.
If the animals cannot understand human language it is more certain that they cannot produce it. Horses cannot learn to say *Moo* even after many years of being kept in a field of cows. Another example is a baby and a puppy which arrive at the same time in some place. They live together, hear the same sounds, however two years later, the baby will make lots of human speech sounds but the puppy will not. 

## Chimpanzees and Language
In the 1930s scientists Luella and Winthrop Kellogg raised a chimpanzee with their son. It was able to understand a hundred words however it could not say any of them. In the 1940s another scientist couple raised chimpanzee as if it was their child. They managed to teach it the articulation of some words such as: *mama*, *papa*, *cup*, however it was done rather poorly. This achievement showed that non-human primates cannot make human speech sounds even if they have wide range of vocal calls.

### Washoe
Beatrix and Allen Gardner wanted to teach a female chimpanzee to use the American Sign Language. Washoe (the chimpanzee) was raised as a human child. She was encouraged to use the sign language when she was around them. After three and a half years she managed to learn more than a hundred words such as *airplane*, *banana*, *window*, *woman*.  Besides that she could form sentences. It was not perfect, however her system of communication had the potential. Washoe could also understand a lot of signs, significantly more than she could form.

### Sarah and Lana
Ann and David Premack also taught a chimpanzee named Sarah to use plastic shapes in order to communicate with humans. She could arrange them to build sentences. Sarah was not raised like a human child as she stayed in a cage. When using the adequate shape she was rewarded with food. Duane Rumbaugh used similar technique in order to train a chimpanzee named Lana. She learnt the language called Yerkish in which she had to press symbols on a keyboard linked to a computer in order to produce the message.

### The Controversy
Even though it looked like Lana and Sarah learnt the word *please*, they actually automatically were choosing it just like on a vending machine where we can operate on without the knowledge of the language. The psychologist Herbert Terrace worked with the chimpanzee named Nim. He claimed that chimpanzees learn certain behaviours or signing in response to the demands of people in order to receive a reward. However the Gardners argued that Washoe produced correct signs without the presence of any human. Chimpanzees can also use signs among each other.

### Kanzi
While teaching a pygmy chimpanzee named Matata how to use Yerkish language, its adopted child, Kanzi, was also present during the process. He learnt the symbol system even better that his parent by just being exposed to it. As the eight-years-old chimpanzee he understood English language at the level of a two-and-a-half-year-old human child. 

## Using Language
Language cannot be defined just by using language. It can be described as a type of communication depending on the situation. However, no other creature than human has been observed using language in a way that makes possible for a child to develop a system of sounds and structures to such extend that it can use infinite number of novel utterances.
