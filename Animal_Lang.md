# Summary
## Animals and Human Language

### Duality
**Duality** (double articulation) occurs in human language. It is organized at two levels. At physical level, which occurs when we speak, individual sounds are created such as *n*, *b*, *i*. None of these forms has any specific meaning. However, when we combine them into, for instance *bin* we get another level with a meaning which differs from the meaning of another combination as *nib*.  We can create many sound combinations that are distinct in meaning with little set of sounds.  Other creatures communicate in single fixed form which cannot be separated. The dog does not say *oowf*, *foow* as other forms of *woof*. However, if they did, each of these forms would have different meaning. 

### Talking to Animals
Human language is a unique communication system. Other creatures are not able to understand it. However, we might assume that they do, because of their behaviour when they hear specific commands such as *Heel* to dogs, *Up*, *Down*, *Roll over* to circus animals. They seem to understand them because of their response, however it cannot be the evidence. They respond particularly to the sound stimulus but do not actually understand the meaning of the noise.
If the animals cannot understand human language it is more certain that they cannot produce it. Horses cannot learn to say *Moo* even after many years of being kept in a field of cows. Another example is a baby and a puppy which arrive at the same time in some place. They live together, hear the same sounds, however two years later, the baby will make lots of human speech sounds but the puppy will not.
