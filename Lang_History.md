## Language History and Change
Philology is a study of language history and change. As it developed in the nineteenth century “family trees” were created, showing how languages were related to one another. First, however, it had to be established which of the many languages were of the same family.
## Family Trees
According to a British government official Sir William Jones, the Sanskrit language cannot have been produced by accident. This hypothesis was one of the first ideas which implied that languages share a common ancestor. In the 19th century this ancient language has earned a name - *Proto-Indo-European* and scholars started looking for common features in modern languages which sprouted into a family tree of different branches of Indo-European languages.
