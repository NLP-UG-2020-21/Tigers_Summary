# Summary
## Language History and Change
Philology is a study of language history and change. As it developed in the nineteenth century “family trees” were created, showing how languages were related to one another. First, however, it had to be established which of the many languages were of the same family.
## Family Trees
According to a British government official Sir William Jones, the Sanskrit language cannot have been produced by accident. This hypothesis was one of the first ideas which implied that languages share a common ancestor. In the 19th century this ancient language has earned a name - *Proto-Indo-European* and scholars started looking for common features in modern languages which sprouted into a family tree of different branches of Indo-European languages.
## Indo-European
Indo-European is one of the language families with the largest population and distribution in the world. There are about thirty such families and 7,097 known languages in the world. The languages of the Indo-European family, though seemingly different, start having more similarities as one looks at the older generation languages. Through a simple comparison of Latin, Sanskrit and Ancient Greek some common features become apparent. Although it is unlikely to find many words with clear similarities, they are enough to make an assumption that certain languages might be related.
The process of finding connections between sets of words is based on using cognates, which are words in languages that resemble one another in form and possibly meaning.
## Comparative Reconstruction
Comparative reconstruction is a procedure of reconstructing information from different, but related languages using sets of cognates. It allows researchers to recreate the possible form of the  “proto” language. This reconstruction is bound by two principles, namely, the majority and the most natural development principle. The first one states that if in a set a particular phoneme appears noticeably more often in comparison to another one, it is highly probable that it was the original sound. The latter discerns between typical, common changes such as final devoicing (e.g. *rizu* > *ris*) and the ones that are unlikely.
